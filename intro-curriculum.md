# w1: Intro Programming Topics

## Language basics

* iteration
 * common idioms
 * prefer each to for
* stepping through code to think about how they work
 * some pythontutor.com substitute?
* Hash, Array, Enumerable, String + Object
 * when to use each
 * common methods
* naming generally
 * Example: variables, always know what they stand for and communicate
   that.
* methods (also called functions)
 * naming
 * single responsibility
 * side-effects vs return values
* stack
 * call stack
 * calculator stack
* shallow vs deep copying
* intro to OO
 * inheritance
 * Everything is an object
* scope
 * what is it?
 * why is it?
 * when is it?
* Exceptions, error handling
* braces and do/end are the same thing
* nil
* bang-methods

## Basic design
* DRY
* recursion
* Method decomposition
  * each method should do something: one thing
    * corollary: methods should be short
  * each method should prefer communicating through result
* Refactoring

## Langauge Intermediate
* PRY and debugger
* blocks and the methods that take them
 * try implementing looping constructs with yield
* mixins
* Rubygems
* modules as namespaces
* introspection: .methods, .class

## OO Design
* Decomposition into objects
* Single responsibility
* Inheritance
* private vs public

## Beginning Topics
* code smells
 * http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/code-smells.html
* Modulus and selecting a random element
* read a file, write a file

## Intermeidate Topics
* rspec
* regex
* git
* rvm: why should you care?
* simplecov
* serialization
* binary trees, depth first search (exercise 11)
* exercises to learn how to read code
 * especially read libraries you don't understand
* command line: now you give the orders

* through ch8 of Eloquent Ruby
